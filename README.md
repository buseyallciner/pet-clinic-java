# PetClinic 🐾
PetClinic2 is a small Java console project I made while practicing OOP concepts.  
It allows adding dogs and cats, listing all pets, and calculating their daily cost.
## Features
- Add new pets (Dog, Cat)
- Show all pets in the system
- Calculate total daily cost using a simple interface (`Billable`)
- Menu-based console application
